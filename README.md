# cleaner_bot_pygame
Pygame project to simulate a simple maping process from a moving robot in a 2d grid. As you control the bot, you see the objects that it perceives with it's sensors.

# running
This requires pygame to work. `pip3 install pygame` should be enough.

`python3 cleaner.py p` runs the game in pygame mode. Use the **arrow keys** to control the bot and **q** to quit (or just close the window).
`python3 cleaner.py m` runs the game in terminal mode. Use the **wasd keys** to control the bot and **q** to quit.
